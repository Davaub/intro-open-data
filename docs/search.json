    "text": "Open Research Data (ORD)\n\nDefinition\n\nResearch data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modeling, interview, or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence Concordat Working Group (2016).\n\n\n\nFor Funding Agencies (and Institutions)\n\nFor the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.\n\n\n\nFor Organizations that Supply Metrics\n\nBe open and transparent by providing data and methods used to calculate all metrics.\n\nProvide the data under a licence that allows unrestricted reuse, and provide computational access to data, where possible.\n\nSan Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA)\n\n\nORD in Switzerland\n\nSNSF Policy\nThe Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) expects all its funded researchers:\n\nto store the research data they have worked on and produced during the course of their research work,\nto share these data with other researchers, unless they are bound by legal, ethical, copyright, confidentiality or other clauses, and\nto deposit their data and metadata onto existing public repositories in formats that anyone can find, access and reuse without restriction.\n\nhttps://www.snf.ch/en/dMILj9t4LNk8NwyR/topic/open-research-data\n\n\nVision\n\nBy facilitating access to and reuse of research data, ORD promotes better, more effective, and more impactful research for the benefit of society as a whole. Through the principles of open access and reusability of research data, ORD practices support transparent and reproducible research findings. Moreover, ORD fosters collaboration by promoting exchange among researchers across disciplines, legal systems and national borders, thus enabling creativity and innovation to thrive (Open Science Delegation, 2021a).\n\n\n\nAction Areas\nThe SNSF has identified four criteria in the action plan (Open Science Delegation, 2021b):\n\nSupport researchers and research communities in imagining and adopting ORD practices\nDevelopment, promotion, and maintenance of financially sustainable basic infrastructures and services for all researchers\nEquipping researchers for ORD skills development and exchange of best practices\nBuilding up systemic und supportive conditions for institutions and research communities\n\n→ for more information, see Wiel et al. (2024)\n\n\n\nResearch Data Management (RDM)\n\nDefinition\nRDM refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project.\n\n\nPurpose\nRDM ensures that research data are well-organised, maintained and accessible for current and future research, thereby improving their reliability, validity and reproducibility.\n\n\n\nData Management Plan (DMP)\n\nDefinition\nA DMP is a formal document that outlines how data will be handled during and after a research project, covering aspects from collection to sharing and preservation.\n\n\nPurpose\nIt serves as a guide for managing data efficiently and meets funding agency requirements for data stewardship. It is now mandatory for most funding agencies to require a DMP as part of the grant application process to secure funding. University libraries often have services and resources to assist researchers in creating these documents, providing expert guidance on best practices in data management.\n\n\n\nRDM and DMP\n\nInterconnected Roles\nRDM encompasses the day-to-day management of research data, while a DMP provides a structured plan for how to manage, share, and preserve data throughout the research project.\n\n\nPlanning and Execution\nA DMP is essentially a blueprint for RDM. It outlines the policies and standards to be applied to the data, ensuring that data management practices are thought through from the outset of the project.\n\n\n\nOpen Governement Data (OGD)\n\nDefinition\n\nThe work of government involves collecting huge amounts of data, much of which is not confidential (economic data, demographic data, spending data, crime data, transport data, etc). The value of much of this data can be greatly enhanced by releasing it as open data, freeing it for re-use by business, research, civil society, data journalists, etc Open Knowledge (2016).\n\nhttps://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/government-data/\n\n\n\nOGD in Switzerland\n\nhttps://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/services/ogd/masterplan.html\n\nLMETA. Art. 10, al. 4\n\nLes données sont mises en ligne gratuitement, en temps utile, sous une forme lisible par machine et dans un format ouvert. Elles peuvent être librement réutilisées, sous réserve d’obligations légales spéciales de mentionner la source des données (Loi fédérale sur l’utilisation des moyens électroniques pour l’exécution des tâches des autorités (LMETA), 2023).\n\n\n\nRelated efforts\n\nNational data management (NaDB): https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/nadb/nadb.html\ni14y Interoperability platform: https://www.i14y.admin.ch/\nDigital Switzerland Strategy: https://digital.swiss/",

It is by definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work. It is ready-to-hand. This image holds up well enough for many purposes – turn on the faucet for a drink of water and you use a vast infrastructure of plumbing and water regulation without usually thinking much about it (Star, 1999).\n\n\n\nDimensions\nAccording to Star (1999), infrastructure can be understood through nine interconnected dimensions:\n\nEmbeddedness: Infrastructure is sunk into and inside of other structures, social arrangements, and technologies. People do not necessarily distinguish the several coordinated aspects of infrastructure.\nTransparency: Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense that it does not have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each task, but invisibly supports those tasks.\nReach or scope: This may be either spatial or temporal – infrastructure has reach beyond a single event or one-site practice.\nLearned as part of membership: Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be learned about. New participants acquire a naturalised familiarity with its objects, as they become members.\nLinks with conventions of practice: Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice.\nEmbodiment of standards: Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures and tools in a standardised fashion.\nBuilt on an installed base: Infrastructure does not grow de novo; it wrestles with the inertia of the installed base and inherits strengths and limitations from that base.\nBecomes visible upon breakdown: The normally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout.\nIs fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally: Because infrastructure is big, layered, and complex, and because it means different things locally, it is never changed from above. Changes take time and negotiations, and adjustment with other aspects of the systems are involved.\n\n\n\n\nText-based formats\n\nPlain Text (TXT)\nWSe2            WS2         MoS2    \n\ndk  Intensity   dk  Intensity   dk  Intensity   \n\n855.87628   63  848.96433   -39 855.87628   372\n855.25787   72.25   848.34546   2   855.25787   424\n854.63942   64.25   847.72654   -39 854.63942   460\n854.02093   58  847.10759   -37 854.02093   362\n853.40239   66  846.4886    -28 853.40239   440\nSohier, T., Ponomarev, E., Gibertini, M., Berger, H., Marzari, N., Ubrig, N., & Morpurgo, A.

It enhances usability by making data more accessible and understandable to a wide range of users, including non-experts and developers. Well-documented data fosters trust by providing transparency about sources, methodologies, and underlying code, while also supporting data integration and application development by enabling seamless combination of data from diverse sources. Below are key types of documentation that contribute to these goals:\n\nData field descriptions/data models\nUser guides\nMetadata\nDeveloper documentation\nSource code documentation\n\n\n\n\nProtocols\nA robust set of rules and standards governs the exchange and accessibility of open data over the internet. These protocols and mechanisms enable accessibility by facilitating standardised and straightforward access to data, which is essential for promoting innovation and transparency. Additionally, they support interoperability, ensuring that data from diverse sources can be efficiently integrated and used together. Below are key technologies and protocols that achieve these goals:\n\nApplication Programming Interface (API): mechanism that enable two software components to communicate with each other\n\nRepresentational State Transfer (REST): a style of API that uses HTTP requests for communication. REST is stateless, i.e. each request from a client to the server is treated as new. There is no stored memory of previous interactions. This means the server does not store any state about the client session on the server side.\nSimple Object Access Protocol (SOAP): a protocol used for exchanging structured information in web services, offering high security and transactional reliability. SOAP can support both stateless and stateful operations.\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP): used for the transfer of data files, particularly large datasets, from one host to another.\nOpen Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH): a protocol for harvesting metadata descriptions of records in an archive, particularly used in digital libraries.\nReally Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary (RSS) / Atom Feeds: used for regularly updating or publishing data that changes frequently. Feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically.\nSPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL): used for querying and manipulating RDF",

    "text": "Open Source / Free Software / F(L)OSS\n\nDefinition and Philosophy\nOpen Source refers to software with source code that can be inspected, modified, and enhanced by anyone. It emphasises collaboration and community-oriented development.\n\n\nKey Characteristics\nIt includes free redistribution, access to source code, and allowance for derived works.\n\n\nCriteria\n\nFree redistribution\nSource code must be included\nDerived works must be allowed\nIntegrity of the author’s source code\nNo discrimation against persons or groups\nNo discrimation against fields of endeavour\nDistribution of licence\nLicence must not be specific to a product\nLicence must not restrict other software\nLicence must be technology-neutral\n\nhttps://opensource.org/osd/\n\n\nFree Software\nFree Software is centred around the idea of user freedom – the freedom to run, study, change, and distribute the software. “Free” refers to freedom, not price.\nIt has four essential freedoms: 1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0). 2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2). 4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\n\n“Free software” means software that respects users’ freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html\n\n\nFree/Libre and Open Source Software\n\nThis is software for which the licensee can get the source code, and is allowed to modify this code and to redistribute the software and the modifications. Many terms are used: free, referring to the freedom to use (not to “free of charge”), libre, which is the French translation of Free/freedom, and which is preferred by some writers to avoid the ambiguous reference to free of charge, and open source, which focuses more on the access to the sources than on the freedom to redistribute. In practice, the differences are not great, and more and more scholars are choosing the term FLOSS to name this whole movement.\n\nJullien (2009)\n“Neutral stance”: See https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html",

A publication is defined ‘open access’ when there are no financial, legal or technical barriers to accessing it - that is to say when anyone can read, download, copy, distribute, print, search for and search within the information, or use it in education or in any other way within the legal agreements.\n\nhttps://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access\n\nOA is a publishing model for scholarly communication that makes research information available to readers at no cost, as opposed to the traditional subscription model in which readers have access to scholarly information by paying a subscription (usually via libraries).\n\nhttps://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access\n\n\n\nPublications are made freely accessible by the publisher immediately upon publication. It often involves Article Processing Charges (APCs) paid by the author, their institution, or a funder.\n→ Immediate OA via publisher\n\n\n\nAuthors publish their work in any journal and then self-archive an earlier version of the article (pre-print) for free public use in a repository (sometimes after an embargo period).\n→ Immediate or delayed OA via self-archiving method/repository\n\n\n\nSubscription-based journals allow authors to make their individual articles OA upon payment of an APC.\n→ Immediate OA via publisher\n\n\n\nJournals do not charge authors APCs and provide immediate OA to all their articles. It operates without direct cost to the authors; funding often comes from institutions, societies, or donations.\n→ Immediate OA via publisher\n\n\n\nArticles made freely accessible on the publisher’s website without an explicit OA licence.\n\n\n\nThrough blue OA, authors can archive the post-print or the publisher’s final version.\n\n\n\nIt refers to the unauthorised distribution of published content through various channels, such as pirate sites or peer-to-peer networks.",

    "text": "About the Instructor\nDr. Julien A. Raemy is an Information Specialist and Digital Humanities Practitioner. He currently works as a Data Scientist at the Swiss Federal Archives.\nHe holds a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Information Science from the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland. He completed his PhD in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel in 2024, with a dissertation titled Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage: Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability. His research examines how cultural heritage institutions can better share their digital collections through LOUD standards, particularly focusing on the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Linked Art specifications. Through analysis of the PIA research project and Yale’s Collections Discovery platform, his work investigates both the social dynamics of communities developing these standards and the technical challenges of making cultural data more interoperable.\nJulien A. Raemy has worked extensively in academia and in or for the cultural heritage domain, including as a Photo Archivist for the Montreux Jazz Digital Project at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne from 2015 to 2017, as a Research and Teaching Assistant at the Haute école de gestion de Genève from 2017 to 2021, and as an Interoperability Specialist at DaSCH, Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanities, from 2021 to 2024. He is also an active member of the IIIF and Linked Art communities."
