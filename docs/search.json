Research (which produces data) should be shared freely for the common good.\n\nSource: https://data.gov/blog/open-data-history\n\n\nTimeline\n\n1942: The concept starts with Robert K. Merton.\n1995: The term ‘Open Data’ first appeared, related to the sharing of geophysical and environmental data.\nNovember 2005: Open Knowledge Foundation creates the Open Definition.\nDecember 2007: The concept of open public data was discussed and defined in Sebastopol, CA, USA at a meeting of Internet activists. They identified 8 principles.\nFebruary 2009: Tim Berners-Lee presents The Next Web at TED2009.

    "text": "Open Research Data (ORD)\n\nDefinition\n\nResearch data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modeling, interview, or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence.\n\n[Concordat Working Group 2016]\n\n\nFor Funding Agencies (and Institutions)\n\nFor the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.\n\n\n\nFor Organizations that Supply Metrics\n\nBe open and transparent by providing data and methods used to calculate all metrics.\n\nProvide the data under a licence that allows unrestricted reuse, and provide computational access to data, where possible.\n\nSan Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA)\n\n\nORD in Switzerland\n\nSNSF Policy\nThe Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) expects all its funded researchers:\n\nto store the research data they have worked on and produced during the course of their research work,\nto share these data with other researchers, unless they are bound by legal, ethical, copyright, confidentiality or other clauses, and\nto deposit their data and metadata onto existing public repositories in formats that anyone can find, access and reuse without restriction.\n\nhttps://www.snf.ch/en/dMILj9t4LNk8NwyR/topic/open-research-data\n\n\nVision\n\nBy facilitating access to and reuse of research data, ORD promotes better, more effective, and more impactful research for the benefit of society as a whole. Through the principles of open access and reusability of research data, ORD practices support transparent and reproducible research findings. Moreover, ORD fosters collaboration by promoting exchange among researchers across disciplines, legal systems and national borders, thus enabling creativity and innovation to thrive.\n\n[Open Science Delegation 2021a]\n\n\nAction Areas\n\nSupport researchers and research communities in imagining and adopting ORD practices\nDevelopment, promotion, and maintenance of financially sustainable basic infrastructures and services for all researchers\nEquipping researchers for ORD skills development and exchange of best practices\nBuilding up systemic und supportive conditions for institutions and research communities\n\n[Open Science Delegation 2021b]\n\n\n\nResearch Data Management (RDM)\n\nDefinition\nRDM refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project.\n\n\nPurpose\nRDM ensures that research data are well-organised, maintained and accessible for current and future research, thereby improving their reliability, validity and reproducibility.\n\n\n\nData Management Plan (DMP)\n\nDefinition\nA DMP is a formal document that outlines how data will be handled during and after a research project, covering aspects from collection to sharing and preservation.\n\n\nPurpose\nIt serves as a guide for managing data efficiently and meets funding agency requirements for data stewardship. It is now mandatory for most funding agencies to require a DMP as part of the grant application process to secure funding. University libraries often have services and resources to assist researchers in creating these documents, providing expert guidance on best practices in data management.\n\n\n\nRDM and DMP\n\nInterconnected Roles\nRDM encompasses the day-to-day management of research data, while a DMP provides a structured plan for how to manage, share, and preserve data throughout the research project.\n\n\nPlanning and Execution\nA DMP is essentially a blueprint for RDM. It outlines the policies and standards to be applied to the data, ensuring that data management practices are thought through from the outset of the project.\n\n\n\nOpen Governement Data (OGD)\n\nDefinition\n\nThe work of government involves collecting huge amounts of data, much of which is not confidential (economic data, demographic data, spending data, crime data, transport data, etc). The value of much of this data can be greatly enhanced by releasing it as open data, freeing it for re-use by business, research, civil society, data journalists, etc.\n\nOpen Data Handbook [Open Knowledge 2016]: https://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/government-data/\n\n\n\nOGD in Switzerland\n\nhttps://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/services/ogd/masterplan.html\n\nLMETA. Art. 10, al. 4\n\nLes données sont mises en ligne gratuitement, en temps utile, sous une forme lisible par machine et dans un format ouvert. Elles peuvent être librement réutilisées, sous réserve d’obligations légales spéciales de mentionner la source des données.\n\n[Loi fédérale sur l’utilisation des moyens électroniques pour l’exécution des tâches des autorités (LMETA) 2023]\n\n\nRelated efforts\n\nNational data management (NaDB): https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/nadb/nadb.html\ni14y Interoperability platform: https://www.i14y.admin.ch/\nDigital Switzerland Strategy: https://digital.swiss/",

It is by definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work. It is ready-to-hand. This image holds up well enough for many purposes – turn on the faucet for a drink of water and you use a vast infrastructure of plumbing and water regulation without usually thinking much about it.\n\n[Star 1999]\n\n\nDimensions\n\nEmbeddedness: Infrastructure is sunk into and inside of other structures, social arrangements, and technologies. People do not necessarily distinguish the several coordinated aspects of infrastructure.\nTransparency: Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense that it does not have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each task, but invisibly supports those tasks.\nReach or scope: This may be either spatial or temporal – infrastructure has reach beyond a single event or one-site practice.\nLearned as part of membership: Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be learned about. New participants acquire a naturalised familiarity with its objects, as they become members.\nLinks with conventions of practice: Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice.\nEmbodiment of standards: Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures and tools in a standardised fashion.\nBuilt on an installed base: Infrastructure does not grow de novo; it wrestles with the inertia of the installed base and inherits strengths and limitations from that base.\nBecomes visible upon breakdown: The normally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout.\nIs fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally: Because infrastructure is big, layered, and complex, and because it means different things locally, it is never changed from above. Changes take time and negotiations, and adjustment with other aspects of the systems are involved.\n\n[Star 1999]\n\n\n\nText-based formats\n\nPlain Text (TXT)\nWSe2            WS2         MoS2    \n\ndk  Intensity   dk  Intensity   dk  Intensity   \n\n855.87628   63  848.96433   -39 855.87628   372\n855.25787   72.25   848.34546   2   855.25787   424\n854.63942   64.25   847.72654   -39 854.63942   460\n854.02093   58  847.10759   -37 854.02093   362\n853.40239   66  846.4886    -28 853.40239   440\nSohier, T., Ponomarev, E., Gibertini, M., Berger, H., Marzari, N., Ubrig, N., & Morpurgo, A.

They ensure consistency and interoperability across different systems and platforms.\n\nCIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM), Dublin Core, Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC), Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)\n\nMetadata schemas are specific implementations of metadata standards. They outline the structure, elements, and attributes of metadata for a specific purpose.\n\nEncoded Archival Description (EAD), Lightweight Information Describing Object (LIDO), Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)\n\nWhile standards provide the “what” and “why” of metadata, schemas offer the “how” for specific data types or field needs.\n\n\n\nData Catalog Vocabulary (Application Profiles)\n\nResource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues published on the Web.\nCurrent version: DCAT 3\n\n\nData Catalog Vocabulary Application Profile (DCAT-AP)\nSpecifications based on DCAT for describing public sector datasets\n\nDCAT Application Profile for data portals in Europe: DCAT-AP 3.0\nDCAT Application Profile for the United States of America: DCAT-US - Version 3\nDCAT Application Profile for Data Portals in Switzerland (DCAT-AP CH): eCH-0200\n\nDCAT-AP CH is a subprofile of DCAT-AP\n\n\nDCAT\nSeven classes/entities:\n\ndcat:Catalog represents a catalogue, which is a dataset in which each individual item is a metadata record describing some resource\ndcat:Resource represents a dataset, a data service or any other resource that may be described by a metadata record in a catalogue.\ndcat:Dataset represents a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent or identifiable community.\ndcat:Distribution represents an accessible form of a dataset such as a downloadable file.\ndcat:DataService represents a collection of operations accessible through an interface (API) that provide access to one or more datasets or data processing functions.\ndcat:DatasetSeries is a dataset that represents a collection of datasets that are published separately, but share some characteristics that group them.\ndcat:CatalogRecord represents a metadata record in the catalogue, primarily concerning the registration information, such as who added the record and when.\n\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#dcat-scope\nex:catalog\n  a dcat:Catalog ;\n  dcterms:title \"Imaginary Catalog\"@en ;\n  dcterms:title \"Catálogo imaginario\"@es ;\n  rdfs:label \"Imaginary Catalog\"@en ;\n  rdfs:label \"Catálogo imaginario\"@es ;\n  foaf:homepage &lt;http://dcat.example.org/catalog&gt; ;\n  dcterms:publisher ex:transparency-office ;\n  dcterms:language &lt;http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en&gt;  ;\n  dcat:dataset ex:dataset-001 , ex:dataset-002 , ex:dataset-003 ;\n  .\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#basic-example\n\n\nDCAT-AP CH\n@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .\n@prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .\n@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt; .\n@prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; .\n\n# ---------- class Catalog --------------------------------------------------\n&lt;https://swisstopo/opendata/catalog&gt;\n  a dcat:Catalog ;\n\n  # mandatory properties\n  dct:description \"Datenkatalog der Stadt Zurich\"@de ;\n  dct:publisher &lt;https://publishers/swisstopo&gt; ;\n  dct:title \"Open Data City of Zurich\"@en ,\n            \"Offene Daten der Stadt Zurich\"@de .\nhttps://www.dcat-ap.ch/releases/2.0/dcat-ap-ch.html#Class:Catalog\n\n\n\nDocumentation\nComprehensive and understandable information about the data, including its source, structure, context, and how to use it effectively.\n\nTypes of Documentation\nClear and comprehensive documentation plays a vital role in maximizing the value of data and systems. It enhances usability by making data more accessible and understandable to a wide range of users, including non-experts and developers. Well-documented data fosters trust by providing transparency about sources, methodologies, and underlying code, while also supporting data integration and application development by enabling seamless combination of data from diverse sources. Below are key types of documentation that contribute to these goals:\n\nData field descriptions/data models\nUser guides\nMetadata\nDeveloper documentation\nSource code documentation\n\n\n\n\nProtocols\nA robust set of rules and standards governs the exchange and accessibility of open data over the internet. These protocols and mechanisms enable accessibility by facilitating standardised and straightforward access to data, which is essential for promoting innovation and transparency. Additionally, they support interoperability, ensuring that data from diverse sources can be efficiently integrated and used together. Below are key technologies and protocols that achieve these goals:\n\nApplication Programming Interface (API): mechanism that enable two software components to communicate with each other\n\nRepresentational State Transfer (REST): a style of API that uses HTTP requests for communication. REST is stateless, i.e. each request from a client to the server is treated as new. There is no stored memory of previous interactions. This means the server does not store any state about the client session on the server side.\nSimple Object Access Protocol (SOAP): a protocol used for exchanging structured information in web services, offering high security and transactional reliability. SOAP can support both stateless and stateful operations.\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP): used for the transfer of data files, particularly large datasets, from one host to another.\nOpen Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH): a protocol for harvesting metadata descriptions of records in an archive, particularly used in digital libraries.\nReally Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary (RSS) / Atom Feeds: used for regularly updating or publishing data that changes frequently. Feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically.\nSPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL): used for querying and manipulating RDF",
