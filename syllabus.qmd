# Syllabus

This course introduces the foundational principles of Open Data, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to find, analyse, and effectively reuse open datasets. Through a combination of lectures, practical activities, and assignments, students will explore the benefits and challenges of Open Data and develop a deeper understanding of its potential applications and implications.

## Learning Objectives 

The course is designed with the following objectives:

1. To gain an understanding of Open Data, its essential aspects, and the principles of opening data;
2. to learn how to find, analyse, and reuse open datasets;
3. to learn the processes involved in preparing and publishing open datasets.

These objectives provide the foundation for the course and guide the learning outcomes.

## Content 

The topics covered in this course include:

- Background on open data;
- benefits and risks of opening data;
- models related to using and publishing open data.

## Methods

The course employs the following methods to support learning:

- Course presentations;
- practical examination and exploration of online services;
- assignments

These methods are intended to foster both theoretical understanding and practical application of the course material.

## Assessment

- Select one or more datasets from one or several platforms discussed during the course (if several datasets are selected, there must be a common thread)
- Analyse, describe and identify the potential uses of the dataset(s)
- Between 900 and 1,100 words (without references)
- Short paper to be uploaded onto Cyberlearn by Friday 14 March, 7pm

This assignment is weighted at 20% of the 7C2-CT module.
