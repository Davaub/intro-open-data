## Learning Objectives 

This course introduces the foundational principles of Open Data, equipping undergraduate students in Information Science with the knowledge and skills to find, analyse, and effectively reuse open datasets. Through a combination of lectures, practical activities, and assignments, students will explore the benefits and challenges of Open Data and develop a deeper understanding of its potential applications and implications. It is designed with the following objectives:

1. To gain an understanding of Open Data, its essential aspects, and the principles of opening data;
2. to learn how to find, analyse, and reuse open datasets;
3. to learn the processes involved in preparing and publishing open datasets.

These objectives provide the foundation for the course and guide the learning outcomes.

## Content 

The topics covered in this course include:

- Background on open data;
- benefits and risks of opening data;
- models related to using and publishing open data.

## Methods

The course employs the following methods to support learning:

- Course presentations;
- practical examination and exploration of online services;
- assignments

These methods are intended to foster both theoretical understanding and practical application of the course material.

## Course Assessment

- Select one or more datasets from one or several platforms discussed during the course (if several datasets are selected, there must be a common thread)
- Analyse, describe and identify the potential uses of the dataset(s)
- Between 900 and 1,100 words (without references)
- Short paper to be uploaded onto Cyberlearn by **Friday 14 March, 7pm**

This assignment is weighted at 20% of the 7C2-CT module.
