## Definitions

### Open(ness)

The term **Open(ness)** can be defined in the following complementary ways:

1. **General Definition**:

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).

The Open Definition according to the [Open Knowledge Network](https://opendefinition.org/).

2. **Principles of Openness**:
    - **No limitations on access**: Accessibility must not depend on cost, authentication, or privileges (national, institutional, or otherwise).
    - **Free and open**: Open knowledge should be shared freely, without cost or barriers.

Derived from the Open Knowledge Foundation's principles and scholarly interpretations.

&rarr; **Key takeaway**: Knowledge funded by public mandates must benefit the public without restrictions @scholgerLegalAspectsArts2023.

### Data

> Data at its most basic level as the absence of uniformity, whether in the real world or in some symbolic system. Only once such data have some recognisable structure and are given some meaning can they be considered information [@floridiInformationVeryShort2010].

[@chenAnalysisInformationVisualisation2013]

### Metadata

> Data whose purpose is to describe and give information about other data. [@oxfordenglishdictionaryMetadata2023]

> (...) there is no fixed boundary between “data” and “metadata”, and that information viewed as data in one discipline may be metadata in another.  [@alterViewPointsData2023]

### Open Data

> Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.

The Open Definition according to the [Open Knowledge Network](https://opendefinition.org/).

## History

### Robert K. Merton (1910–2003)

American sociologist, considered a founding father of modern sociology, said in 1942:

> Each researcher must contribute to the 'common pot' and give up intellectual property rights to allow knowledge to move forward.

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_open-access_movement)

> While the term “open data” isn’t even 20 years old, the author puts the concept in a historical context; the idea that scientific research should be free to all was popularized by Robert King Merton in the early 1940s. Research (which produces data) should be shared freely for the common good.

### Timeline

- **1942**: The concept starts with Robert K. Merton.
- **1995**: The term 'Open Data' first appeared, related to the sharing of geophysical and environmental data.
- **November 2005**: Open Knowledge Foundation creates the Open Definition.
- **December 2007**: The concept of open public data was discussed and defined in Sebastopol, CA, USA at a meeting of Internet activists. They identified 8 principles.
- **February 2009**: Tim Berners-Lee presents [The Next Web](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_the_next_web) at TED2009. He famously asked for "raw data now".

### The Sebastopol Meeting

In December 2007, thirty thinkers and activists of the Internet held a meeting in Sebastopol, north of San Francisco. Their aim was to define the concept of open public data and have it adopted by the US presidential candidates.

Among them were:

- Tim O’Reilly: An American author and editor who defined and popularized concepts such as open source and Web 2.0.
- Lawrence Lessig: Professor of Law at Stanford University and founder of Creative Commons licenses.
- Adrian Holovaty: Founder of EveryBlock, a localized information service.
- Tom Steinberg: Founder of the FixMyStreet site.
- Aaron Swartz: Inventor of RSS and free knowledge activist.

Together, they created principles to define and evaluate open public data.

## Open Research Data (ORD)

### Definition

> Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modeling, interview, or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence @concordatworkinggroupConcordatOpenResearch2016.

### For Funding Agencies (and Institutions)

3. For the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (**including datasets** and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.

### For Organizations that Supply Metrics

11. Be open and transparent by providing data and methods used to calculate all metrics.  
12. Provide the data under a licence that allows unrestricted reuse, and provide computational access to data, where possible.

[San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA)](https://sfdora.org/read/)

### ORD in Switzerland

#### SNSF Policy

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) expects all its funded researchers:

- to store the research data they have worked on and produced during the course of their research work,
- to share these data with other researchers, unless they are bound by legal, ethical, copyright, confidentiality or other clauses, and
- to deposit their data and metadata onto existing public repositories in formats that anyone can find, access and reuse without restriction.

<https://www.snf.ch/en/dMILj9t4LNk8NwyR/topic/open-research-data>

#### Vision

> By facilitating access to and reuse of research data, ORD promotes better, more effective, and more impactful research for the benefit of society as a whole. Through the principles of open access and reusability of research data, ORD practices support transparent and reproducible research findings. Moreover, ORD fosters collaboration by promoting exchange among researchers across disciplines, legal systems and national borders, thus enabling creativity and innovation to thrive [@opensciencedelegationSwissNationalOpen2021].

#### Action Areas

The SNSF has identified four criteria in the action plan [@opensciencedelegationSwissNationalStrategy2021]:

1. Support researchers and research communities in imagining and adopting ORD practices
2. Development, promotion, and maintenance of financially sustainable basic infrastructures and services for all researchers 
3. Equipping researchers for ORD skills development and exchange of best practices
4. Building up systemic und supportive conditions for institutions and research communities 

### Research Data Management (RDM)

#### Definition

RDM refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project.

#### Purpose

RDM ensures that research data are well-organised, maintained and accessible for current and future research, thereby improving their reliability, validity and reproducibility.

### Data Management Plan (DMP)

#### Definition

A DMP is a formal document that outlines how data will be handled during and after a research project, covering aspects from collection to sharing and preservation.

#### Purpose

It serves as a guide for managing data efficiently and meets funding agency requirements for data stewardship. It is now mandatory for most funding agencies to require a DMP as part of the grant application process to secure funding. University libraries often have services and resources to assist researchers in creating these documents, providing expert guidance on best practices in data management.

### RDM and DMP

#### Interconnected Roles

RDM encompasses the day-to-day management of research data, while a DMP provides a structured plan for how to manage, share, and preserve data throughout the research project.

#### Planning and Execution

A DMP is essentially a blueprint for RDM. It outlines the policies and standards to be applied to the data, ensuring that data management practices are thought through from the outset of the project.

### Open Governement Data (OGD)

#### Definition

> The work of government involves collecting huge amounts of data, much of which is not confidential (economic data, demographic data, spending data, crime data, transport data, etc). The value of much of this data can be greatly enhanced by releasing it as open data, freeing it for re-use by business, research, civil society, data journalists, etc @openknowledgeOpenDataHandbook2016.

<https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/services/ogd/masterplan.html>

#### LMETA. Art. 10, al. 4

> Les données sont mises en ligne gratuitement, en temps utile, sous une forme lisible par machine et dans un format ouvert. Elles peuvent être librement réutilisées, sous réserve d’obligations légales spéciales de mentionner la source des données [@confederationsuisseLoiFederaleUtilisation2023].

### Open Government Data Principles

1. **Complete**: All public data is made available. Public data is data that is not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations.
2. **Primary**: Data is as collected at the source, with the highest possible level of granularity, not in aggregate or modified forms.
3. **Timely**: Data is made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data.
4. **Accessible**: Data is available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes.
5. **Machine processable**: Data is reasonably structured to allow automated processing.
6. **Non-discriminatory**: Data is available to anyone, with no requirement of registration.
7. **Non-proprietary**: Data is available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control.
8. **License-free**: Data is not subject to any copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret regulation. Reasonable privacy, security and privilege restrictions may be allowed.

<https://public.resource.org/8_principles.html>

## Requirements

1. **Legally open**: available under an open (data) licence that permits anyone freely to access, reuse and redistribute
2. **Technically open**: data is available for no more than the cost of reproduction and in machine-readable and bulk form.

<https://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-data/>

## Licences

### Copyright and Copyleft

#### Copyright
- Grants creators exclusive rights to control use, reproduction, and distribution.
- Designed to protect creators' economic interests; allows monetization of work.

#### Copyleft
- Allows use, modification, and distribution with the condition of keeping works and derivatives open.
- Promotes freedom, sharing of knowledge, and collaborative improvement.

For further information about licences &rarr; Competence Center in Digital Law: <https://www.ccdigitallaw.ch/> 

### Anglo-Saxon Copyright vs. European Author's Rights

#### Anglo-Saxon Copyright
- Focuses on economic rights; treats copyright as transferable property.
- Duration based on set years post-creation or author's life plus years.

#### European Author's Rights (_droit d'auteur / Urheberrecht_)
- Emphasises moral rights alongside economic rights.
- Grants inalienable moral rights to creators; duration includes lifetime plus post-death period (commonly 70 years).

### Responsable AI Licenses (RAIL)

Responsible AI Licenses (RAIL) are a class of licenses designed to encourage the responsible use of an AI artifact being licensed by including a set of use restrictions applied to AI artifact. RAILs can be more or less restrictive depending on the aims of the licensor. For instance, a license can be RAIL while being a proprietary license, or a license just allowing the use of the AI feature for research purposes and without allowing distribution of derivative versions. 

In contrast, Open & Responsible AI Licenses (OpenRAIL) are a subclass of RAIL licenses that permit free-of-charge open access and re-use of AI artifacts for commercial purposes, while including usage restrictions. Note that usage restrictions in RAIL Licenses also apply to any derivatives of AI artifact. 

RAILs can be used to license data (D), Apps (A), models (M), and source code (S). depending on the AI feature(s) you are licensing, you will add suffix D, A, M, or S

### I Hate AI License (IHAIL)

- Based on CC BY 4.0
- It prohibits the use of the material with Artifical Intelligence (AI) technologies while allowing sharing, adaptation, and commercial use under certain terms.

<https://ihateailicense.eu/>

### Recommendations for Open (Research) Data

@santosDonneesRechercheCadre2020 suggests assigning Creative Commons licenses to open datasets in the following order of preference:

1. [![](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/cc0.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) **CC0** (to the fullest extent allowed by law, as a complete waiver is not feasible under Swiss regulations) 
2. [![](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/cc-by.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) CC BY 4.0
3. [![](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/cc-by-sa.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) CC BY-SA 4.0

![](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/santos-arbre.svg)

## Technical means

### Important factors in providing structured data for machines

- Data(set) formats
    - Text-based formats
    - Binary-encoded formats
- Metadata standards / schemas (to describe the dataset)
- Documentation
- Protocols

And of course the underlying infrastructure...

### Infrastructure

#### Definitions

> A collective term for the subordinate parts of an undertaking; substructure, foundation [@oxfordenglishdictionaryInfrastructure2023].

> People commonly envision infrastructure as a system of substrates – railroad, lines, pipes and plumbing, electrical power plants, and wires. **It is by definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work**. It is ready-to-hand. This image holds up well enough for many purposes – turn on the faucet for a drink of water and you use a vast infrastructure of plumbing and water regulation without usually thinking much about it [@starEthnographyInfrastructure1999].

#### Dimensions

According to @starEthnographyInfrastructure1999, infrastructure can be understood through nine interconnected dimensions:

- **Embeddedness**: Infrastructure is sunk into and inside of other structures, social arrangements, and technologies. People do not necessarily distinguish the several coordinated aspects of infrastructure.
- **Transparency**: Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense that it does not have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each task, but invisibly supports those tasks.
- **Reach or scope**: This may be either spatial or temporal -- infrastructure has reach beyond a single event or one-site practice.
- **Learned as part of membership**: Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be learned about. New participants acquire a naturalised familiarity with its objects, as they become members.
- **Links with conventions of practice**: Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice.
- **Embodiment of standards**: Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures and tools in a standardised fashion.
- **Built on an installed base**: Infrastructure does not grow *de novo*; it wrestles with the inertia of the installed base and inherits strengths and limitations from that base.
- **Becomes visible upon breakdown**: The normally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout.
- **Is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally**: Because infrastructure is big, layered, and complex, and because it means different things locally, it is never changed from above. Changes take time and negotiations, and adjustment with other aspects of the systems are involved.

This script was done to download the metadata of [e-periodica](https://www.e-periodica.ch/) through 
their OAI-PMH endpoint (`https://www.e-periodica.ch/oai`) that could be interesting to the PIA research 
project as we want to link our image-based collections to the e-periodica articles. 

There are more than 16k metadata articles which have 
the 390 `setSpec` (Ethnology, folklore) on e-periodica. Probably, the more relevant articles 
come from the `Korrespondenzblättern der SGV` (more than 2k articles), divided into these three sources:

### Metadata standards / schemas

- **Metadata standards** are sets of rules and guidelines that dictate how metadata should be formatted and used. They ensure consistency and interoperability across different systems and platforms.
  - CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM), Dublin Core, Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC), Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)
- **Metadata schemas** are specific implementations of metadata standards. They outline the structure, elements, and attributes of metadata for a specific purpose.
  - Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Lightweight Information Describing Object (LIDO), Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)

  _While standards provide the "what" and "why" of metadata, schemas offer the "how" for specific data types or field needs._

### Data Catalog Vocabulary (Application Profiles)

- Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues published on the Web.
- Current version: [DCAT 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/)
 
#### Data Catalog Vocabulary Application Profile (DCAT-AP)

Specifications based on DCAT for describing public sector datasets

- DCAT Application Profile for data portals in Europe: [DCAT-AP 3.0](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/)
- DCAT Application Profile for the United States of America: [DCAT-US - Version 3](https://doi-do.github.io/dcat-us/)
- DCAT Application Profile for Data Portals in Switzerland (DCAT-AP CH): [eCH-0200](https://ech.ch/fr/ech/ech-0200/2.0.0)

_DCAT-AP CH is a subprofile of DCAT-AP_

#### DCAT

Seven main classes/entities:

1. `dcat:Catalog` represents a catalogue, which is a dataset in which each individual item is a metadata record describing some resource
2. `dcat:Resource` represents a dataset, a data service or any other resource that may be described by a metadata record in a catalogue.
3. `dcat:Dataset` represents a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent or identifiable community. 
4. `dcat:Distribution` represents an accessible form of a dataset such as a downloadable file.
5. `dcat:DataService` represents a collection of operations accessible through an interface (API) that provide access to one or more datasets or data processing functions.
6. `dcat:DatasetSeries` is a dataset that represents a collection of datasets that are published separately, but share some characteristics that group them.
7. `dcat:CatalogRecord` represents a metadata record in the catalogue, primarily concerning the registration information, such as who added the record and when.

### Documentation

Comprehensive and understandable information about the data, including its source, structure, context, and how to use it effectively.

#### Types of Documentation 

Clear and comprehensive documentation plays a vital role in maximizing the value of data and systems. It enhances usability by making data more accessible and understandable to a wide range of users, including non-experts and developers. Well-documented data fosters trust by providing transparency about sources, methodologies, and underlying code, while also supporting data integration and application development by enabling seamless combination of data from diverse sources. Below are key types of documentation that contribute to these goals:

- Data field descriptions/data models
- User guides
- Metadata
- Developer documentation
- Source code documentation

### Protocols

A robust set of rules and standards governs the exchange and accessibility of open data over the internet. These protocols and mechanisms enable accessibility by facilitating standardised and straightforward access to data, which is essential for promoting innovation and transparency. Additionally, they support interoperability, ensuring that data from diverse sources can be efficiently integrated and used together. Below are key technologies and protocols that achieve these goals:

- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: mechanism that enable two software components to communicate with each other
  - **Representational State Transfer (REST)**: a style of API that uses HTTP requests for communication. REST is stateless, _i.e. each request from a client to the server is treated as new. There is no stored memory of previous interactions. This means the server does not store any state about the client session on the server side_.
  - **Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)**: a protocol used for exchanging structured information in web services, offering high security and transactional reliability. SOAP can support both stateless and stateful operations.
- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: used for the transfer of data files, particularly large datasets, from one host to another.
- **Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)**: a protocol for harvesting metadata descriptions of records in an archive, particularly used in digital libraries.
- **Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary (RSS) / Atom Feeds**: used for regularly updating or publishing data that changes frequently. Feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically.
- **SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL)**: used for querying and manipulating RDF
