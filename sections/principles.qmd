## FAIR Data Principles 

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/FAIR_data_principles.jpg)

<https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/> [@wilkinsonFAIRGuidingPrinciples2016]

### Findable

- F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
- F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1)
- F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
- F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

### Accessible

- A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
  - A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
  - A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
- A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

### Interoperable

- I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

### Reusable

- R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
  - R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
  - R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
  - R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

## Collections as Data

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collectionsasdata/part2whole/master/_posts/cad_logo_matte.png)

### Summits

- 2017: Santa Barbara Statement [@padillaAlwaysAlreadyComputational2017]
- 2023: Vancouver Statement [@padillaVancouverStatementCollections2023]

### Main outputs

- 10 principles
- 'Part to Whole' Report
- Related checklist and initiatives

<https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/>

### 10 Principles

1. Collections as Data development aims to encourage computational use of digitised and born digital collections.
2. Collections as Data stewards are guided by ongoing ethical commitments.
3. Collections as Data stewards aim to lower barriers to use.
4. Collections as Data designed for everyone serve no one.
5. Shared documentation helps others find a path to doing the work. 
6. Collections as Data should be made openly accessible by default, except in cases where ethical or legal obligations preclude it.
7. Collections as Data development values interoperability.
8. Collections as Data stewards work transparently in order to develop trustworthy, long-lived collections.
9. Data as well as the data that describe those data are considered in scope. 
10. The development of collections as data is an ongoing process and does not necessarily conclude with a final version. 
 
### Part to Whole

- **Boundary Object Concept**: Collections-as-data serve as flexible tools adaptable to various needs while maintaining a common identity [see @starInstitutionalEcologyTranslations1989].
- **Ethical Considerations**: Emphasis on ethical development and use of collections, especially concerning marginalized communities.
- **Community Engagement**: Essential for respecting and understanding the context of collections.
- **Organisational Structure Support**: Effective initiatives require collaboration across various organisational departments.
- **Documentation Importance**: Crucial for understanding and maintaining collections in the future.
- **Community of Practice**: Emphasises the need for skill sharing and collaborative environments.
- **Future Challenges and Opportunities**
  - Integration of AI and computational tools in collections.
  - Navigating the balance between global collaboration and local cultural sensitivities.
  - Addressing financial and resource limitations for global community growth.
  - Potential and risks of using collections as data for AI training.

## Linked (Open) (Usable) Data

### An Open Vision of the Web

> The [World Wide Web] project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system. The project started with **the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone**.

@berners-leeWorldWideWebExecutiveSummary1991

### Linked Data

Linked Data refers to a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF, and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and queried.

### Linked Data Principles

- Use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as names for things
- Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
- When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (e.g. RDF, RDFS, SPARQL, etc.)
- Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things.

@berners-leeLinkedData2006

### Linked Open Data (LOD)

Linked Open Data is a subset of Linked Data that is open, meaning it is freely accessible and reusable by anyone. It adheres to the principles of being accessible under an open license, available in a machine-readable format, using open standards from the W3C (such as RDF and SPARQL), and linked to other datasets to increase its utility.

### The Semantic Web or _the Web of Data_

The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web, through standards, to make it machine-readable.

![](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/tweaked-semweb-layer-cake.webp)

@idehenSemanticWebLayer2017

### Resource Description Framework (RDF)

With RDF, everything goes in threes. Most of the triples' components have Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). <br/>
Syntax: **subject, predicate, object** $(s \ \vec{p} \ o)$ 

![](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/rdf-graph.svg)

With RDF, everything goes in threes, the data model contains so-called triples: that is *subject*, *predicate*, *object* that form graphs.
Most of the components of these triples use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and are generally web-addressable, whether for naming subjects and objects (which may themselves also be objects of other triples) or relationships 

### Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

The concept of LOUD extends LOD by emphasising not just the openness and interlinking of data but also its usability.

- The term was coined by Robert Sanderson [-@sandersonShoutItOut2018;-@sandersonKeynoteStandardsCommunities2019] who has been involved in the conception and maintenance of web standards, mainly in the cultural heritage field. 
- LOUD's goal is to achieve the Semantic Web's intent on a global scale in a usable fashion by leveraging community-driven and JSON-LD-based specifications.
- It has five main design principles to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics. 

#### LOUD Design Principles

- The right Abstraction for the audience
- Few Barriers to entry
- Comprehensible by introspection
- Documentation with working examples
- Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns

<https://linked.art/loud/>

#### LOUD Standards/Communities

- [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF)
- [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/)
- [Linked Art](https://linked.art)

The IIIF and Linked Art communities are built on a synergy of social and technical integration, with a strong focus on usability. They are unified by shared expertise and leadership, fostering collaboration across technical boundaries. These communities prioritise inclusivity and diversity of participation, ensuring that a wide range of perspectives contribute to their work. Openness and friendliness are core values, along with a strong commitment to transparency in processes and decision-making. To facilitate engagement and knowledge sharing, they organise both online and face-to-face meetings to strengthen connections across the community.

[see @newburyLOUDLinkedOpen2018; @raemyCharacterisingIIIFLinked2023]


##### International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)

- A model for presenting and annotating content
- A global community that develops shared application programming interfaces (APIs), implements them in software, and exposes interoperable content

##### Web Annotation Data Model

The Web Annotation Data Model, standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 2017, provides an extensible and interoperable framework for creating and sharing annotations across different platforms. It supports a wide range of use cases, from simple annotations to linking content with multimedia data points. It leverages JSON-LD for serialization, enabling integration with the web’s structured data ecosystem while following Linked Data principles [see @haslhoferOpenAnnotationCollaboration2011; @sandersonDesigningW3COpen2013].

The model follows a three-part structure:
- **Target**: The resource being annotated.
- **Body**: The annotation content (text, image, media, etc.).
- **Annotation**: The entity linking the body and target.

This model ensures compatibility with web architecture and facilitates cross-platform sharing of annotations.

##### Linked Art

Linked Art is a community and a CIDOC (_ICOM International Committee for Documentation_) Working Group collaborating to define a metadata application profile for describing cultural heritage, and the technical means for conveniently interacting with it (the API). 

<https://linked.art>

###### Community

Linked Art is an open community initiative where participants collaborate under a shared code of conduct. Ways to engage include attending events, joining the [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/linked-art), participating in the Slack workspace, or contributing to discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues).

A wide range of institutions contribute to Linked Art, including **The Metropolitan Museum of Art**, **J. Paul Getty Trust**, **Yale University**, **Smithsonian Institution**, **Europeana**, **Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN)**, **Oxford University**, **Victoria and Albert Museum**, **Rijksmuseum**, **The Frick Collection**, **Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)**, and many more. Since 2019, an editorial board has overseen Linked Art, ensuring diverse representation across institutions and disciplines.
