  abstract = {Sharing data across scientific domains is often impeded by differences in the language used to describe data and metadata.\&nbsp; We argue that disagreements over the boundary between data and metadata are a common source of confusion.\&nbsp; Information appearing as data in one domain may be considered metadata in another domain, a process that we call “semantic transposition.”\&nbsp; To promote greater understanding, we develop new terminology for describing how data and metadata are structured, and we show how it can be applied to a variety of widely used data formats.\&nbsp; Our approach builds upon previous work, such as the Observations and Measurements (ISO 19156) data model. We rely on tools from the Data Documentation Initiative’s Cross Domain Integration (DDI-CDI) to illustrate how the same data can be represented in different ways, and how information considered data in one format can become metadata in another format.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to offer a checklist that can be used for both creating and evaluating digital collections, which are also sometimes referred to as data sets as part of the collections as data movement, suitable for computational use. Design/methodology/approach The checklist was built by synthesising and analysing the results of relevant research literature, articles and studies and the issues and needs obtained in an observational study. The checklist was tested and applied both as a tool for assessing a selection of digital collections made available by galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) institutions as proof of concept and as a supporting tool for creating collections as data. Findings Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in making available digital collections published by GLAM organisations for computational use. Based on previous work, the authors defined a methodology to build a checklist for the publication of Collections as data. The authors’ evaluation showed several examples of applications that can be useful to encourage other institutions to publish their digital collections for computational use. Originality/value While some work on making available digital collections suitable for computational use exists, giving particular attention to data quality, planning and experimentation, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of the work to date provides an easy-to-follow and robust checklist to publish collection data sets in GLAM institutions. This checklist intends to encourage small- and medium-sized institutions to adopt the collection as data principles in daily workflows following best practices and guidelines.},

The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the Research Data Alliance) is a network of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the ‘CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance’ (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organizations, and governments. The CARE Principles are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’ (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The CARE Principles build upon earlier work by the Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data Sovereignty Network, US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network, Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective, and numerous Indigenous Peoples, nations, and communities. The goal is that stewards and other users of Indigenous data will ‘Be FAIR and CARE.’ In this first formal publication of the CARE Principles, we articulate their rationale, describe their relation to the FAIR Principles, and present examples of their application.},

  abstract = {Philosophers have relied on visual metaphors to analyse ideas and explain their theories at least since Plato. Descartes is famous for his system of axes, and Wittgenstein for his first design of truth table diagrams. Today, visualisation is a form of ‘computer-aided seeing’ information in data. Hence, information is the fundamental ‘currency’ exchanged through a visualisation pipeline. In this article, we examine the types of information that may occur at different stages of a general visualization pipeline. We do so from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. The quantitative analysis is developed on the basis of Shannon’s information theory. The qualitative analysis is developed on the basis of Floridi’s taxonomy in the philosophy of information. We then discuss in detail how the condition of the ‘data processing inequality’ can be broken in a visualisation pipeline. This theoretic finding underlines the usefulness and importance of visualisation in dealing with the increasing problem of data deluge. We show that the subject of visualisation should be studied using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, preferably in an interdisciplinary synergy between information theory and the philosophy of information.},

The aim is not only to seek more information but to find new approaches of understanding the way in which people’s memory relate to the collective, public form of archival memory and ultimately how users figure in and shape the digital archive. We provide a proof-of-concept workflow based on automatically generated annotations comprising 53,481 photos that were subjected to object detection using Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2. Of the detected objects, 184,609 have a detection score greater than 0.5, 123,529 have a score greater than 0.75, and 88,442 have a score greater than 0.9. A threshold of 0.75 was set for the dissemination of our annotations, compatible with the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) and embedded in our IIIF Manifests. In the near future, the workflow will be upgraded to allow for the co-existence of various, and occasionally conflicting, assertions made by both human and machine users. We believe that Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) standards should be used to improve the sustainability of such an ecosystem and to foster collaboration between actors in cultural heritage.},

  abstract = {Whatever its name, Free/Libre or Open Source Software (FLOSS), diffusion represents one of the main evolutions of the Information Technology (IT) industry in recent years. Operating System Linux, or Web server Apache (more than 60\% market share on its market), database MySQL or PHP languages are some examples of broadly-used FLOSS programs. One of the most original characteristics of this movement is its collective, cooperative software development organization in which a growing number of firms is involved (some figures in Lakhani \& Wolf (2005)). Of course, programs, because they are codified information, are quite easy to exchange, and make the cooperation easier than in other industries. But, as pointed out by Stallman (1998), if sharing pieces of software within firms was a dominant practice in the 1950’s, it declined in the 1970’s, and almost disappeared in the 1980’s, before regaining and booming today. This article aims at explaining the evolution (and the comeback) of a cooperative, non-market production. In the first part, we explain the decrease of cooperation as a consequence of the evolution of the computer users, of their demand, and of the industrial organization constructed to meet this demand. This theoretical and historical framework is used in the second part to understand the renewal of a cooperative organization, the FLOSS phenomenon, first among computer-literate users, and then within the industry.},

Institutions large and small, individually and collectively, have invested in developing, providing access to, and supporting responsible computational use of collections as data. An updated statement was~needed in light of increased community implementation of collections as data in context of an ever more complex data landscape.~ The Vancouver Statement suggests a set of principles for thinking through questions that collections-as-data work produces, as part of an expanding global, interprofessional, and interdisciplinary effort to empower memory, knowledge, and data stewards (e.g., practitioners and scholars) who aim to support responsible development and computational use of collections as data. This stewardship role only grows in importance as artificial intelligence applications, trained on vast amounts of data, including collections as data, impact our lives ever more pervasively. The Vancouver Statement is the product of diverse contributions from the participants of the working event,~Collections as Data: State of the Field and Future Directions,~held April 25-26, 2023 at Internet Archive Canada in addition to asynchronous community feedback. Professional translation of the Vancouver Statement was provided by Transolution.~Special thanks go to Gimena del Rio Riande and Gaëlle Béquet for additional review of statement translations.},

It also seeks to situate these initiatives within a broader discourse of scholarly movements and principles. Additionally, it serves as a preliminary means of exploring the prospective impact of Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) and its underlying design principles in the cultural heritage field.},

  abstract = {Digital technologies have fundamentally transformed the ways in which Cultural Heritage (CH) collections are accessed and engaged with. Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) specifications, including the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Presentation API 3.0, Linked Art, and the Web Annotation Data Model (WADM), have emerged as web standards to facilitate the description and dissemination of these valuable resources. Despite the widespread adoption of IIIF, the implementation of LOUD specifications, especially in combination, remains challenging. This is particularly true in the development and assessment of infrastructures, or sites of assemblage, that support these standards. The research is guided by two perspectives, namely community practices and semantic interoperability. The former aims to assess how organisations, individuals, and apparatuses engage with and contribute to the consensus-making processes surrounding LOUD. By examining community practices, the social fabrics of the LOUD ecosystem can be better understood. The latter perspective explores how data can be made meaningful to machines in a standardised and interoperable approach that promotes the exchange of well-formed information. This work is grounded as part of the SNSF-funded research project Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) (2021-2025), which aims to develop a citizen science platform around three photographic collections from the Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS) archives. The theoretical framework is firmly rooted in Actor-Network Theory (ANT), as one of the aims of the thesis is to describe the collaborative structures of the LOUD ecosystem and to highlight the importance of non-human actors. Beyond the implementation of LOUD standards within the PIA research project, the empirical research includes an analysis of the social fabrics of the IIIF and Linked Art communities, as well as an investigation of LUX, Yale Collections Discovery platform. The research aims to identify the socio-technical requirements for developing specifications consistent with LOUD design principles. It also seeks to understand how the implementation of LOUD standards within PIA contributes to recognising their potential benefits and limitations in terms of facilitating data reuse and wider participation. The thesis further examines the implementation strategies, challenges, and outcomes of Yale University’s large-scale deployment of LOUD standards, focusing on how ensuring the consistency of Linked Art and IIIF resources within the LUX platform contributes to the CH domain. The core methodology of this thesis is an actor- and practice-centred inquiry, focusing on the detailed examination of specific cosmologies within LOUD-driven communities, PIA, and LUX. This approach aims to unravel the intricate web of cultural processes and constellations through a micro-perspective, rich in empirical evidence. Key empirical findings indicate that LOUD improves the discoverability and integration of data in CH, which requires community-driven consensus on model interoperability. Significant challenges include engaging marginalised groups, sustaining long-term engagement, and balancing technological and social considerations. The strategic use of technology and the capture of digital materiality are critical, yet LOUD presents challenges in terms of resource investment, data consistency, and the wider implementation of complex patterns. LOUD should clearly lead efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of CH data. The community-driven methodology of IIIF and Linked Art inherently promotes collaboration and transparency, making these standards critical tools in the ongoing evolution of data management. Even for projects and institutions that do not adopt these specifications, LOUD's socio-technical practices provide crucial insights into effective digital stewardship and community engagement strategies.},

It draws on the work of amateurs, professionals, administrators and others connected to the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, during its early years. Extending the Latour-Callon model of interessement, two major activities are central for translating between viewpoints: standardization of methods, and the development of 'boundary objects'. Boundary objects are both adaptable to different viewpoints and robust enough to maintain identity across them. We distinguish four types of boundary objects: repositories, ideal types, coincident boundaries and standardized forms.},

This paper proposes a framework to assess the impact of releasing open data by applying the Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach. SROI was developed for organizations intended to generate social and environmental benefits thus fitting the purpose of most open data initiatives. We link the four steps of SROI (input, output, outcome, impact) with the 14 high-value data categories of the G8 Open Data Charter to create a matrix of open data examples, activities, and impacts in each of the data categories. This Impact Monitoring Framework helps data providers to navigate the impact space of open data laying out the conceptual basis for further research.},

  abstract = {There is no clear-cut boundary between Free and Open Source Software and Open Scholarship, and the histories, practices, and fundamental principles between the two remain complex. In this study, we critically appraise the intersections and differences between the two movements. Based on our thematic comparison here, we conclude several key things. First, there is substantial scope for new communities of practice to form within scholarly communities that place sharing and collaboration/open participation at their focus. Second, Both the principles and practices of FOSS can be more deeply ingrained within scholarship, asserting a balance between pragmatism and social ideology. Third, at the present, Open Scholarship risks being subverted and compromised by commercial players. Fourth, the shift and acceleration towards a system of Open Scholarship will be greatly enhanced by a concurrent shift in recognising a broader range of practices and outputs beyond traditional peer review and research articles. In order to achieve this, we propose the formulation of a new type of institutional mandate. We believe that there is substantial need for research funders to invest in sustainable open scholarly infrastructure, and the communities that support them, to avoid the capture and enclosure of key research services that would prevent optimal researcher behaviours. Such a shift could ultimately lead to a healthier scientific culture, and a system where competition is replaced by collaboration, resources (including time and people) are shared and acknowledged more efficiently, and the research becomes inherently more rigorous, verified, and reproducible.},
