# Introduction to Open Data

The course is designed for undergraduate students in Information Science at the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland, [Haute école de gestion de Genève (HEG-GE)](https://hesge.ch/heg/). It provides a comprehensive introduction to Open Data, covering key aspects such as:

- [Characteristics of Open Data](sections/characteristics.qmd)
- [Associated Movements](sections/movements.qmd)
- [Associated Principles](sections/principles.qmd)
- [Open Data Platforms and Organisations](sections/platforms.qmd)
- [Assessment, Data Quality, and Best Practices](sections/assessment.qmd)
- [Techniques, Software, and Tools](sections/techniques.qmd)
- [Showcases](sections/showcases.qmd)

## Why Open Data matters... TL;DR

### Public Engagement and Empowerment

- Open data empowers the public by providing access to information that was previously inaccessible or difficult to obtain.
- This fosters a more informed citizenry and enables individuals and communities to participate actively in civic and cultural discourses.

### Transparency and Accountability

- Open data enhances transparency and accountability, particularly in sectors where public trust is paramount.
- By making data freely accessible, open data initiatives allow for greater scrutiny and analysis, leading to more accountable governance and institutional practices.

### AI and Machine Learning

- Open (and structured) data is crucial for AI and ML systems, providing the large datasets necessary for training models.
- The availability of diverse, high-quality open datasets enables more robust and inclusive AI developments.
- Open data fosters transparency and ethical practices in AI by ensuring external validation and reducing biases.

### Collaboration is Key

- Collaboration is a fundamental aspect of open data initiatives.
  - Discussing best practices grounded in collaboration, such as leveraging the Collections as Data checklist.
  - Participating in the IIIF and Linked Art communities for the cultural heritage field (and beyond, notably for the STEM sector).
  - OGD meet-ups (Open Data Beer).
- Such collaboration is vital for addressing global challenges, encouraging innovation, and ensuring the sustainable development of open data ecosystems.

## A multitude of tools

> For a better understanding of the past, <br/>
Our images have to be enhanced, <br/>
A new dialogue in three dimensions, <br/>
Must have openness at its heart, <br/>
For somewhere within the archive <br/>
Of our aggregated minds <br/>
Are a multitude of questions <br/>
And a multitude of answers, <br/>
Simply awaiting to be found.
